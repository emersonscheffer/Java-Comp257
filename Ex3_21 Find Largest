//3.21 (Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the largest value is used frequently
//in computer applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest
//would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most 
//units wins the contest. Write a pseudocode program, then a Java application that inputs a 
//series of 10 integers and determines and prints the largest integer. Your program should use at 
//least the following three variables:
//a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been input
//and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
//b) number:Theinteger most recently input by the user.
//c) largest: The largest number found so far.
