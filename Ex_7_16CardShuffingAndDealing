//(Card Shuffling and Dealing) Modify the application of Fig. 7.13 to deal
//a five-card poker hand. Then modify class DeckOfCards of Fig. 7.12 to include
//methods that determine whether a hand contains

//a) a pair
//b) two pairs
//c) three of a kind (e.g., three jacks)
//d) four of a kind (e.g., four aces)
//e) a flush (i.e., all five cards of the same suit)
//f) a straight (i.e., five cards of consecutive face values)
//g) a full house (i.e., two cards of one face value and three cards of another face value)
//[Hint: Add methods getFace and getSuit to class Card of Fig. 7.11.]
