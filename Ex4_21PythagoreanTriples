//(Pythagorean Triples) A right triangle can have sides whose lengths are all integers.
//The set of three integer values for the lengths of the sides of a right triangle is 
//called a Pythagorean triple. The lengths of the three sides must satisfy the relationship 
//that the sum of the squares of two of the sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

//Write an application that displays a table of the Pythagorean triples for side1, side2 
//and the hypotenuse, all no larger than 500. Use a triple-nested for loop that tries all
//possibilities.
//This method is an example of “brute-force” computing. You’ll learn in more
//advanced computer science courses that for many interesting problems there’s no known 
//algorithmic approach other than using sheer brute force.
