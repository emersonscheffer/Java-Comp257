//Develop a Java application that determines the gross pay for each of three employees. 
//The company pays straight time for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and time 
//and a half for all hours worked in excess of 40. You’re given a list of the employees,
//their number of hours worked last week and their hourly rates. Your program should input
//this information for each employee, then determine and display the 
//employee’s gross pay. Use class Scanner to input the data.
